gtk+/xfwm4 theme based on ClassicLooks and Greybird

note:

the gtk+4 theme is not finished, and i'm currently only using it for gajim which is why the scrollbars are like that
p.s. you can run nicotine+ using gtk+3

the wallpaper im using is from blahat@misskey.io [link](https://media.misskeyusercontent.jp/io/a66c34a1-93ac-443b-8408-60cdfcd9742f.webp)

qt programs can be themed with [qt5gtk2](https://github.com/trialuser02/qt5gtk2) and [qt6gtk2](https://github.com/trialuser02/qt5gtk2)
we havent had easily themeable gui toolkit since gtk fucking 2 #suicide

icons i like are elementaryos icons](https://github.com/shimmerproject/elementary-xfce)
fonts i like are [inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) and [fragment mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fragment+Mono)
